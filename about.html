        <h3>
            The Xenon Science Congress is a biennial gathering of scientists and engineers from around the world who are interested in the science and technology of xenon. The congress provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and information on all aspects of xenon research, from basic science to applied applications.

            The first Xenon Science Congress was held in 1995 in Seattle, Washington. Since then, the congress has been held every two years in different cities around the world. The most recent congress was held in 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.
            
            The Xenon Science Congress is organized by the Xenon Science Society, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the study of xenon. The society's members include scientists and engineers from academia, industry, and government.
            
            The Xenon Science Congress features a variety of presentations, including keynote lectures, invited talks, contributed papers, and posters. The congress also includes a number of social events, such as a welcome reception, a banquet, and a tour of a local laboratory or facility.
            
            The Xenon Science Congress is a valuable opportunity for scientists and engineers to learn about the latest advances in xenon research, to network with colleagues from around the world, and to share their own research findings.
